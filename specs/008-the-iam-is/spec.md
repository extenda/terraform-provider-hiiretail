# Feature Specification: Multi-API Provider User Experience Enhancement

**Feature Branch**: `008-the-iam-is`  
**Created**: October 2, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "The IAM is only the first of many Hii Retail APIs which will be managed by our new provider. We need to make it easier for users to understand and success with the provider. Therefore it should look like other Terraform Providers where there are a large number of APIs to manage. For example, the GCP Terraform provider."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a DevOps engineer or infrastructure developer, I want to use the HiiRetail Terraform provider to manage multiple HiiRetail APIs (IAM, Business Units, CCC, etc.) in a way that feels familiar and intuitive, similar to how I use the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Terraform provider to manage many different GCP services.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am new to HiiRetail services, **When** I explore the provider documentation, **Then** I should easily understand what services are available and how they relate to each other
2. **Given** I want to set up IAM resources, **When** I look at the provider structure, **Then** I should find clear, logically organized resource types and data sources
3. **Given** I am experienced with other major cloud providers, **When** I use the HiiRetail provider, **Then** the experience should feel familiar in terms of organization, naming conventions, and documentation structure
4. **Given** I need to manage multiple HiiRetail services, **When** I configure the provider, **Then** I should have a consistent authentication and configuration experience across all services
5. **Given** I want to learn about a specific resource, **When** I access the documentation, **Then** I should find comprehensive examples, parameter explanations, and common use cases

### Edge Cases
- What happens when users try to find resources for services that haven't been implemented yet?
- How does the system guide users when they're looking for functionality that exists in other providers but isn't available in HiiRetail?
- How does the provider handle version compatibility across different HiiRetail APIs?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Provider MUST organize resources and data sources in a logical, service-based structure that mirrors major cloud providers like GCP
- **FR-002**: Provider MUST provide comprehensive documentation that includes service overviews, resource relationships, and real-world examples
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to discover available resources through clear naming conventions and categorization
- **FR-004**: Provider MUST offer consistent authentication and configuration patterns across all HiiRetail services
- **FR-005**: Documentation MUST include getting started guides, best practices, and migration patterns from other providers
- **FR-006**: Provider MUST support service-specific configuration blocks for managing different HiiRetail APIs
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to understand resource dependencies and relationships through clear documentation and examples
- **FR-008**: Provider MUST include examples showing how to manage multiple services together (e.g., IAM + inventory management)
- **FR-009**: Documentation MUST provide comparison guides showing how to achieve common tasks compared to other major cloud providers
- **FR-010**: Provider MUST include troubleshooting guides and common error resolution patterns

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Documentation MUST be generated automatically from code to ensure consistency
- **NFR-002**: Provider structure MUST be extensible to accommodate future HiiRetail services without breaking changes
- **NFR-003**: User onboarding experience MUST reduce time-to-first-success compared to current implementation

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Provider Configuration**: Centralized authentication and service endpoint configuration for all HiiRetail APIs
- **Service Module**: Logical grouping of resources and data sources for each HiiRetail API (IAM, inventory, pricing, etc.)
- **Resource Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for each resource including examples, parameters, and relationships
- **Getting Started Guide**: Step-by-step documentation for new users to understand and use the provider effectively
- **Migration Guide**: Documentation comparing HiiRetail provider patterns to other major cloud providers
