# Feature Specification: OAuth2 Authentication with Environment-Specific Endpoints

**Feature Branch**: `007-oauth2-authentication-with`  
**Created**: October 1, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "OAuth2 authentication with correct endpoints for HiiRetail IAM Terraform provider. Use auth.retailsvc.com for token endpoint. Use iam-api.retailsvc.com for Live Tenants and iam-api.retailsvc-test.com for Test Tenants based on Tenant ID parsing. Support mock server override for testing."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature describes OAuth2 authentication system with environment-specific endpoints
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Terraform provider, OAuth2 server, IAM API, test mock server
   ‚Üí Actions: authenticate, parse tenant ID, route to correct endpoint
   ‚Üí Data: OAuth2 tokens, tenant IDs, API endpoints
   ‚Üí Constraints: hardcoded auth endpoint, environment-based IAM routing, mock override
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Tenant ID parsing logic specified but format not detailed
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Provider authentication flow with Live/Test tenant routing
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí OAuth2 flow, endpoint routing, mock server support
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí OAuth2 credentials, tenant configurations, API endpoints
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec ready for implementation planning
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a Terraform user configuring HiiRetail IAM resources, I need the provider to automatically authenticate with the correct IAM API endpoint based on whether I'm working with Live or Test tenants, so that my infrastructure configurations work seamlessly across environments without manual endpoint configuration.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Live Tenant ID, **When** the provider authenticates, **Then** it obtains an OAuth2 token from auth.retailsvc.com and routes API calls to iam-api.retailsvc.com
2. **Given** a Test Tenant ID, **When** the provider authenticates, **Then** it obtains an OAuth2 token from auth.retailsvc.com and routes API calls to iam-api.retailsvc-test.com
3. **Given** a mock server configuration for testing, **When** the provider is configured for testing, **Then** it routes both authentication and API calls to the mock server endpoints
4. **Given** valid OAuth2 credentials, **When** the provider starts up, **Then** it successfully obtains and uses access tokens for IAM API requests

### Edge Cases
- What happens when tenant ID format is invalid or unrecognizable?
- How does the system handle OAuth2 authentication failures?
- What occurs when the determined IAM API endpoint is unreachable?
- How does mock server override behavior work during automated testing?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Provider MUST authenticate using OAuth2 client credentials flow against auth.retailsvc.com
- **FR-002**: Provider MUST parse tenant IDs to determine Live vs Test environment classification
- **FR-003**: Provider MUST automatically route to iam-api.retailsvc.com for Live Tenant operations
- **FR-004**: Provider MUST automatically route to iam-api.retailsvc-test.com for Test Tenant operations
- **FR-005**: Provider MUST support mock server URL override for testing scenarios
- **FR-006**: Provider MUST handle OAuth2 token refresh and expiration automatically
- **FR-007**: Provider MUST validate OAuth2 credentials before attempting API operations
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide clear error messages for authentication and routing failures
- **FR-009**: Provider MUST maintain consistent API behavior regardless of target environment

### Key Entities
- **OAuth2 Credentials**: Client ID and secret for authentication against auth.retailsvc.com
- **Tenant Configuration**: Tenant ID and its derived environment classification (Live/Test)
- **API Endpoints**: Environment-specific IAM API URLs with authentication token requirements
- **Mock Server Configuration**: Test-time endpoint overrides for both authentication and API calls
