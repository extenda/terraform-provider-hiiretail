# Feature Specification: Correctly Handle Client Credentials

**Feature Branch**: `006-correctly-handle-client`  
**Created**: October 1, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "correctly handle client credentials"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Parsed: "correctly handle client credentials"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: OAuth2 client credentials flow, authentication, error handling, token management
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Marked specific clarifications needed for edge cases and implementation scope
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Defined primary authentication flow and error scenarios
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Created testable requirements for credential handling
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí OAuth2 token, client configuration, authentication state
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec contains some [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers for edge cases
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with noted clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Terraform user configuring the HiiRetail IAM provider, I need the provider to properly authenticate with the IAM API using my OAuth2 client credentials so that I can manage IAM resources securely and reliably without authentication failures or token-related errors.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have valid client credentials configured, **When** I run terraform operations, **Then** the provider should successfully authenticate and perform IAM operations
2. **Given** I have invalid client credentials, **When** I run terraform operations, **Then** the provider should fail fast with a clear authentication error message
3. **Given** my access token expires during a long-running operation, **When** the provider makes subsequent API calls, **Then** it should automatically refresh the token and continue the operation
4. **Given** I have configured credentials via environment variables, **When** I run terraform, **Then** the provider should use those credentials correctly
5. **Given** I have network connectivity issues during token acquisition, **When** the provider attempts authentication, **Then** it should retry appropriately and provide clear error messages

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the OAuth2 token endpoint is unreachable?
- How does the system handle token refresh failures during operations?
- What occurs when client credentials are revoked mid-operation?
- How are concurrent token refresh requests handled?
- What happens with malformed or incomplete credential configurations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Provider MUST authenticate using OAuth2 client credentials flow with the configured token endpoint
- **FR-002**: Provider MUST validate that all required credential parameters (client_id, client_secret, tenant_id) are present before attempting authentication
- **FR-003**: Provider MUST automatically handle token expiration by refreshing tokens when API calls return authentication errors
- **FR-004**: Provider MUST support configuration of client credentials via both provider configuration block and environment variables
- **FR-005**: Provider MUST fail gracefully with clear error messages when authentication fails due to invalid credentials
- **FR-006**: Provider MUST handle network timeouts and connection failures during token acquisition with appropriate retry logic
- **FR-007**: Provider MUST securely handle client secrets without logging or exposing them in error messages
- **FR-008**: Provider MUST cache valid tokens to avoid unnecessary authentication requests for the duration of their validity
- **FR-009**: Provider MUST handle concurrent operations without race conditions in token management
- **FR-010**: Provider MUST validate token endpoint URLs and fail early if they are malformed [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific URL validation rules not specified]
- **FR-011**: Provider MUST retry token acquisition attempts [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: number of retries and backoff strategy not specified]
- **FR-012**: Provider MUST handle token revocation scenarios [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific behavior when tokens are revoked externally not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **OAuth2 Token**: Represents the access token with expiration time, used for API authentication
- **Client Configuration**: Contains client_id, client_secret, tenant_id, and token endpoint URL
- **Authentication State**: Tracks current authentication status, token validity, and retry attempts
