# Feature Specification: Terraform Provider OIDC Authentication and Testing

**Feature Branch**: `001-ensure-that-the`  
**Created**: September 28, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "ensure that the generated Terraform code for the provider in the internal folder is correct by creating a test for it. The provider should support OIDC client credentials flow. The provider needs to take an optional base_url argument."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Validated: Feature description provided and clear
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: OIDC client credentials authentication, optional base_url parameter, provider testing
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All aspects are sufficiently clear from existing provider configuration
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Provider configuration scenarios defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Provider configuration entity identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No clarifications needed, implementation details avoided
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a DevOps engineer using Terraform to manage IAM resources, I need a reliable Terraform provider that can authenticate using OIDC client credentials flow and connect to different environments through configurable base URLs, so that I can safely deploy and manage IAM configurations across multiple environments (development, staging, production).

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have valid OIDC client credentials, **When** I configure the provider with client_id and client_secret, **Then** the provider successfully authenticates and can manage IAM resources
2. **Given** I need to connect to a custom IAM API endpoint, **When** I specify a base_url in the provider configuration, **Then** the provider uses that URL instead of the default
3. **Given** I don't specify a base_url, **When** I configure the provider, **Then** it uses the default base URL for the IAM API
4. **Given** I provide invalid OIDC credentials, **When** I attempt to use the provider, **Then** I receive a clear authentication error message
5. **Given** I specify an invalid base_url, **When** I configure the provider, **Then** I receive a clear connectivity error message

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the OIDC token expires during a long-running operation?
- How does the provider handle network timeouts when connecting to the base_url?
- What occurs if the base_url is malformed or unreachable?
- How are authentication failures communicated to the user?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Provider MUST support OIDC client credentials flow for authentication using client_id and client_secret parameters
- **FR-002**: Provider MUST accept an optional base_url parameter to specify the IAM API endpoint
- **FR-003**: Provider MUST use a default base_url when none is specified by the user
- **FR-004**: Provider MUST validate that required authentication parameters (client_id, client_secret, tenant_id) are provided
- **FR-005**: Provider MUST handle OIDC token refresh automatically when tokens expire
- **FR-006**: Provider MUST provide clear error messages for authentication failures
- **FR-007**: Provider MUST provide clear error messages for connectivity issues with the specified base_url
- **FR-008**: Provider MUST be thoroughly tested with unit tests covering all authentication scenarios
- **FR-009**: Provider MUST be tested with integration tests that validate actual OIDC authentication flow
- **FR-010**: Provider MUST validate base_url format when provided (proper URL structure)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Provider Configuration**: Contains authentication credentials (client_id, client_secret, tenant_id) and optional base_url for API endpoint
- **OIDC Token**: Temporary authentication token obtained through client credentials flow, managed internally by the provider
- **Test Suite**: Comprehensive test coverage including unit tests for provider configuration validation and integration tests for authentication flows
