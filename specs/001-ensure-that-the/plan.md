**Branch**: `001-ensure-that-the` | **Date**: September 28, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-ensure-that-the/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → ✅ COMPLETE: Feature spec loaded successfully
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → ✅ COMPLETE: Project Type: Terraform Provider (Go), all technical details resolved
   → ✅ COMPLETE: Structure Decision based on Terraform provider standards
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
   → ✅ COMPLETE: Constitution requirements mapped to implementation
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → ✅ COMPLETE: No violations detected, all principles satisfied
   → ✅ COMPLETE: Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → ✅ COMPLETE: No NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain, implementation already complete
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file
   → ✅ COMPLETE: Design artifacts generated
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → ✅ COMPLETE: No new violations, design compliant
   → ✅ COMPLETE: Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
   → ✅ COMPLETE: Task generation strategy defined
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
   → ✅ COMPLETE: Plan execution finished
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Primary requirement: Implement and test OIDC client credentials authentication for HiiRetail IAM Terraform provider with optional base_url parameter. Technical approach: Go-based Terraform provider using HashiCorp Plugin Framework with comprehensive unit and integration testing, OAuth2 client credentials flow, and proper validation.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Go 1.21+  
**Primary Dependencies**: HashiCorp Terraform Plugin Framework, golang.org/x/oauth2, terraform-plugin-framework-validators  
**Storage**: N/A (stateless provider)  
**Testing**: Go test framework with unit tests and integration tests using httptest  
**Target Platform**: Multi-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)
**Project Type**: Single project (Terraform provider)  
**Performance Goals**: <500ms provider configuration, efficient token refresh  
**Constraints**: Secure credential handling, no credential logging, TLS-only communications  
**Scale/Scope**: Enterprise multi-tenant environments, multiple deployment environments

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

| Principle | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| I. Provider Interface Standards | ✅ PASS | Complete CRUD schema definitions, HashiCorp conventions followed, proper error handling implemented |
| II. Resource Implementation Completeness | ✅ PASS | Provider configuration fully implemented with all required operations |
| III. Authentication & Security (NON-NEGOTIABLE) | ✅ PASS | OAuth2 client credentials implemented, sensitive values marked, no credential logging, TLS enforced |
| IV. Testing & Validation | ✅ PASS | Comprehensive unit tests, integration tests with mock OIDC server, acceptance test patterns |
| V. Documentation & Examples | ✅ PASS | Complete README with configuration examples, usage patterns, error handling documentation |

**Overall Status**: ✅ PASS - All constitutional principles satisfied

**Structure Decision**: Single Terraform provider project following HashiCorp standards with internal package structure, comprehensive test coverage, and proper documentation.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

**Research Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Implementation already finished, no unknowns remain

All technical decisions have been made and implemented:
- **Decision**: OAuth2 client credentials flow with golang.org/x/oauth2
- **Rationale**: Industry standard, secure, automatic token refresh
- **Alternatives considered**: Basic auth (rejected - less secure), API keys (rejected - no standard refresh)

**Output**: research.md (implementation complete, no research phase needed)

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Design Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All design artifacts exist

1. **Data Model**: Provider configuration entity with tenant_id, client_id, client_secret, base_url fields
2. **API Contracts**: OIDC token endpoint contract, IAM API base URL validation
3. **Contract Tests**: Mock OIDC server tests, configuration validation tests
4. **Integration Tests**: Real authentication flow validation
5. **Agent Context**: Provider implementation details and testing patterns

**Output**: data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate validation and enhancement tasks from existing implementation
- Each test scenario → test validation task [P]
- Each configuration parameter → validation enhancement task [P] 
- Documentation → documentation improvement task
- Security review → security validation task

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Validation first: Ensure existing tests pass
- Enhancement order: Security → Configuration → Documentation → Examples
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent validations)

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered validation and enhancement tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation enhancements (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

No violations detected - all constitutional principles are satisfied by the current implementation.

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command) - Implementation already complete
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command) - Artifacts exist
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (none)
