# Feature Specification: Improve Code Coverage

**Feature Branch**: `013-improve-code-coverage`  
**Created**: 2025-10-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "improve code coverage"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A maintainer wants to ensure the Terraform provider codebase is robust and reliable by increasing the percentage of code covered by automated tests. This includes unit, integration, and acceptance tests for all provider functions, resource operations, and error handling logic.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the current codebase, **When** maintainers review test coverage reports, **Then** they see a measurable increase in code coverage percentage compared to the previous baseline.
2. **Given** new or previously untested code paths, **When** tests are added and executed, **Then** those paths are covered and validated by automated tests.
3. **Given** a CI pipeline, **When** all tests are run, **Then** the pipeline passes only if coverage meets the defined threshold.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if a code path is difficult to test due to external dependencies or side effects?
- How does the system handle code that is intentionally excluded from coverage (e.g., generated code, deprecated features)?
- What is the process if coverage cannot be increased without major refactoring?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a clear baseline code coverage report for the provider codebase.
- **FR-002**: System MUST enable maintainers to identify untested code paths and prioritize them for test creation.
- **FR-003**: System MUST support adding new tests (unit, integration, acceptance) to cover previously untested logic.
- **FR-004**: System MUST update CI pipelines to enforce a minimum code coverage threshold for all releases.
- **FR-005**: System MUST document the process for measuring, reporting, and improving code coverage.
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow maintainers to justify exclusions from coverage (e.g., generated code, legacy code).
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide guidance for testing code with external dependencies or side effects.
- **FR-008**: System MUST ensure that all new features and bug fixes include appropriate test coverage before merging.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Code Coverage Report**: Represents the percentage of code covered by automated tests, including breakdowns by file, function, and test type.
- **Test Suite**: Collection of unit, integration, and acceptance tests for the provider codebase.
- **CI Pipeline**: Automated workflow that runs tests and enforces coverage thresholds.
