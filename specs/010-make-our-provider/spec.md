# Feature Specification: Provider Distribution and Availability

**Feature Branch**: `010-make-our-provider`  
**Created**: October 7, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "make our provider available to others"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Description parsed: "make our provider available to others"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identified: distribution, external access, provider sharing, public availability
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Distribution method - Terraform Registry, GitHub releases, or package registry?]
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Target audience - internal teams, external partners, or public users?]
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Authentication/authorization requirements for accessing the provider?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → User flow: discover → download → install → configure → use provider
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement focuses on distribution and accessibility
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   → Provider package, documentation, version metadata
7. Run Review Checklist
   → WARN "Spec has uncertainties - clarification needed on distribution method and audience"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after clarifications)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a Terraform user (internal team member, external partner, or public user), I want to easily discover, download, and use the HiiRetail Terraform provider so that I can manage HiiRetail IAM resources in my infrastructure as code workflows.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user needs the HiiRetail provider, **When** they search for it in their preferred distribution channel, **Then** they can find the provider with clear documentation and installation instructions
2. **Given** a user has found the provider, **When** they follow the installation process, **Then** they can successfully install and configure the provider in their Terraform environment
3. **Given** a user has installed the provider, **When** they reference it in their Terraform configuration, **Then** they can authenticate and manage HiiRetail resources without issues
4. **Given** a new version of the provider is released, **When** users check for updates, **Then** they can easily upgrade to the latest version

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to install an incompatible version for their Terraform version?
- How does the system handle authentication failures during provider configuration?
- What occurs when the distribution channel is temporarily unavailable?
- How are deprecated provider versions communicated to users?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a discoverable location where users can find the HiiRetail Terraform provider
- **FR-002**: System MUST package the provider in a format compatible with standard Terraform installation methods
- **FR-003**: System MUST include comprehensive documentation covering installation, configuration, and usage
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide version information and compatibility details for each provider release
- **FR-005**: System MUST support authentication configuration for accessing HiiRetail APIs
- **FR-006**: System MUST include examples demonstrating common use cases and resource configurations
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear error messages when installation or configuration fails
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility or provide migration guidance for breaking changes
- **FR-009**: Distribution method MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific distribution channel not specified - Terraform Registry, GitHub releases, internal registry?]
- **FR-010**: Access control MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: authentication/authorization requirements not specified - public access, authenticated users, or restricted access?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST target [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: intended audience not specified - internal teams only, external partners, or general public?]

### Key Entities
- **Provider Package**: Compiled provider binary with version metadata, platform compatibility information, and checksums
- **Documentation Bundle**: Installation guides, configuration reference, API documentation, and usage examples
- **Release Metadata**: Version information, changelog, compatibility matrix, and deprecation notices
- **Distribution Channel**: Platform or service hosting the provider packages and metadata
