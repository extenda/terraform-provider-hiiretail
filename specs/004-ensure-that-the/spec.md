# Feature Specification: Add Comprehensive Tests for IAM Custom Role Resource

**Feature Branch**: `004-ensure-that-the`  
**Created**: September 28, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Ensure that the iam_custom_role resource is correctly implemented by adding tests"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature requires comprehensive testing for existing iam_custom_role resource
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Terraform users, developers, infrastructure teams
   ‚Üí Actions: Create, read, update, delete custom roles, validate schema, test permissions
   ‚Üí Data: Custom roles with permissions, attributes, tenant associations
   ‚Üí Constraints: Permission limits, validation rules, API contracts
3. For each unclear aspect: (all clear from existing resource schema)
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary focus: Ensure resource functionality through comprehensive testing
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focuses on test coverage and validation
6. Identify Key Entities: Custom roles, permissions, attributes
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All requirements testable and focused on validation
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a DevOps engineer managing IAM infrastructure, I need comprehensive tests for the iam_custom_role Terraform resource to ensure that custom roles are created, modified, and deleted correctly with proper validation of permissions and attributes, so that I can confidently deploy infrastructure changes without breaking role-based access control.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an iam_custom_role resource configuration with valid permissions, **When** I run terraform plan and apply, **Then** the custom role should be created successfully with all specified permissions and attributes
2. **Given** an existing custom role with permissions, **When** I modify the permissions list and apply changes, **Then** the role should be updated with the new permissions without losing existing attributes
3. **Given** an iam_custom_role configuration with invalid permission format, **When** I run terraform validate, **Then** validation should fail with clear error messages about permission format requirements
4. **Given** an existing custom role, **When** I remove the resource from configuration and apply, **Then** the role should be deleted from the IAM system
5. **Given** a custom role configuration with attributes, **When** I import an existing role, **Then** the state should correctly reflect all role properties including permissions and attributes

### Edge Cases
- What happens when permission limits are exceeded (100 general, 500 POS permissions)?
- How does the system handle malformed permission IDs that don't match the required pattern?
- What occurs when attributes exceed the size limits (10 properties, 40 char keys, 256 char values)?
- How are concurrent modifications to the same role handled?
- What happens when the IAM API is temporarily unavailable during resource operations?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST validate that iam_custom_role resource can create custom roles with all required and optional attributes
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate that permission IDs follow the pattern {systemPrefix}.{resource}.{action} with proper character constraints
- **FR-003**: System MUST enforce permission limits (100 general permissions, 500 POS permissions) through validation tests
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate that attributes object has maximum 10 properties with keys up to 40 characters and values up to 256 characters
- **FR-005**: System MUST test proper CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for custom roles
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate schema compliance and attribute type checking for all resource fields
- **FR-007**: System MUST test error handling for malformed configurations and API failures
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate state management including import functionality for existing roles
- **FR-009**: System MUST test integration with provider authentication and tenant context
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate concurrent access patterns and race condition handling
- **FR-011**: System MUST test performance characteristics for roles with maximum allowed permissions
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate proper cleanup and resource destruction without orphaned resources

### Key Entities
- **Custom Role**: IAM role with custom permissions, containing id, name, permissions list, tenant_id
- **Permission**: Individual permission with id (following specific pattern), alias (computed), and optional attributes object
- **Attributes**: Key-value object with size constraints for extending permission metadata
- **Tenant Context**: Tenant scope for role operations, inherited from provider configuration
