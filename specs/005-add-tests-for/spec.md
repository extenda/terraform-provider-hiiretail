# Feature Specification: IAM Role Binding Resource Implementation and Testing

**Feature Branch**: `005-add-tests-for`  
**Created**: September 30, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add tests for the iam_role_binding_resource"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Implement complete IAM Role Binding resource with comprehensive testing
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Terraform users, system administrators
   ‚Üí Actions: Create, read, update, delete role bindings; bind users/groups to custom roles
   ‚Üí Data: Role bindings with role_id, bindings list, tenant context
   ‚Üí Constraints: Max 10 bindings per resource, OAuth2 authentication required
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All aspects clear from existing provider patterns and schema
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: manage role assignments via Terraform
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable against existing provider infrastructure
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Role Binding: Links roles to users/groups with tenant isolation
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] - following established provider patterns
   ‚Üí No implementation details exposed to user
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator using Terraform, I need to manage role bindings so that I can assign custom roles to users and groups within my tenant, enabling proper access control for my HiiRetail IAM system. The role binding resource should integrate seamlessly with existing custom roles and groups, providing full lifecycle management through Terraform's standard create, read, update, and delete operations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have a custom role and a group, **When** I create a role binding resource linking them, **Then** the binding is persisted and can be retrieved with proper tenant isolation
2. **Given** I have an existing role binding, **When** I add additional bindings to the same resource, **Then** all bindings are updated atomically up to the maximum of 10 bindings
3. **Given** I have a role binding resource in my Terraform state, **When** I import it using `terraform import`, **Then** the resource state matches the actual remote configuration
4. **Given** I remove a role binding from my Terraform configuration, **When** I run `terraform apply`, **Then** the binding is cleanly removed from the remote system
5. **Given** I have role bindings configured, **When** I run `terraform plan`, **Then** the current state is accurately reflected without unexpected changes

### Edge Cases
- What happens when attempting to create more than 10 bindings in a single resource?
- How does the system handle binding to non-existent roles or groups?
- What occurs when the OAuth2 authentication fails during role binding operations?
- How are role bindings managed when the underlying custom role is deleted?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a complete IAM role binding resource implementation with Create, Read, Update, Delete operations
- **FR-002**: System MUST enforce maximum of 10 bindings per role binding resource as defined in the schema
- **FR-003**: System MUST support both custom and system role binding types through the is_custom boolean flag
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain tenant isolation for all role binding operations using proper tenant context
- **FR-005**: System MUST integrate with existing OAuth2 client credentials authentication flow
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide comprehensive test coverage including unit tests, integration tests, and contract tests
- **FR-007**: System MUST support Terraform import functionality for existing role bindings
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide proper error handling and validation for all role binding operations
- **FR-009**: System MUST integrate with existing mock server infrastructure for reliable testing
- **FR-010**: System MUST register the role binding resource with the provider for availability to users
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate role_id references and binding format according to business rules
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide appropriate diagnostic messages for troubleshooting role binding issues

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Role Binding**: Represents the assignment of roles to users or groups, containing role_id (required), bindings list (required, max 10), is_custom flag (optional, default false), tenant_id (computed), and id (computed)
- **Integration Points**: Connects with existing Custom Role resources, Group resources, and OAuth2 authentication system within the tenant boundary
