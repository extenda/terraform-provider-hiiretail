# Feature Specification: Group Resource Test Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `002-ensure-that-the`  
**Created**: September 28, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "ensure that the Group resource is properly implemented by created tests"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚úì Description: Create comprehensive test coverage for IAM Group resource
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚úì Actors: Terraform provider users, System administrators
   ‚úì Actions: Create, read, update, delete IAM groups
   ‚úì Data: Group entities with name, description, status, tenant_id
   ‚úì Constraints: Validation rules, required fields, length limits
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: API endpoints for group operations not specified]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Authentication requirements for group management not defined]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚úì Clear user flows identified for CRUD operations
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚úì Each requirement is testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚úì Group entity with defined attributes
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding API implementation"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a platform administrator, I need to manage IAM groups through Terraform configuration so that I can organize users into logical groupings and apply consistent permissions across environments.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid Terraform configuration with group resource, **When** applying the configuration, **Then** the IAM group is created with specified name and optional description
2. **Given** an existing IAM group, **When** updating the group's description through Terraform, **Then** the group is updated without recreating the resource
3. **Given** an existing IAM group, **When** destroying the Terraform configuration, **Then** the IAM group is properly removed from the system
4. **Given** invalid group configuration (e.g., name exceeding 255 characters), **When** validating the configuration, **Then** appropriate validation errors are returned
5. **Given** an existing group with the same name, **When** attempting to create a duplicate group, **Then** the operation fails with a clear error message

### Edge Cases
- What happens when group name contains special characters or Unicode?
- How does the system handle concurrent modifications to the same group?
- What occurs when the underlying IAM service is temporarily unavailable?
- How are orphaned groups handled when Terraform state is corrupted?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow creation of IAM groups with required name attribute
- **FR-002**: System MUST support optional description field with maximum 255 characters
- **FR-003**: System MUST auto-generate unique group ID when not provided
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate group name length does not exceed 255 characters
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide computed status field showing group state
- **FR-006**: System MUST support optional tenant_id for multi-tenant scenarios
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle group updates without forcing resource recreation
- **FR-008**: System MUST properly clean up groups when Terraform configuration is destroyed
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide meaningful error messages for validation failures
- **FR-010**: System MUST authenticate with IAM service using [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: authentication method not specified - OIDC, API key, service account?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST interact with IAM service via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: API endpoints and protocols not specified]

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Group operations MUST complete within reasonable time (< 30 seconds)
- **NFR-002**: System MUST handle network failures gracefully with retry logic
- **NFR-003**: Group resource MUST integrate seamlessly with existing Terraform workflow

### Key Entities
- **Group**: Represents an IAM group entity with attributes:
  - name (required): Human-readable group identifier
  - description (optional): Explanatory text about group purpose
  - id (computed): System-generated unique identifier
  - status (computed): Current state of the group
  - tenant_id (optional): Multi-tenant isolation identifier
