# Research: Group Resource Test Implementation

**Created**: September 28, 2025  
**Feature**: 002-ensure-that-the

## Research Overview
This document consolidates technical research for implementing comprehensive test coverage for the IAM Group resource in the HiiRetail Terraform Provider.

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Testing Framework Selection
**Decision**: Use Go's built-in testing package with testify for assertions and HashiCorp's terraform-plugin-testing for acceptance tests

**Rationale**: 
- Standard Go testing provides excellent tooling and IDE integration
- testify adds readable assertions and test utilities
- terraform-plugin-testing is the official HashiCorp framework for provider acceptance tests
- Consistent with existing provider test patterns

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Ginkgo/Gomega: More verbose, less standard in Terraform ecosystem
- Pure Go testing: Lacks assertion helpers and readability
- Custom test framework: Unnecessary complexity

### 2. Mock Strategy for Integration Tests
**Decision**: Use httptest.Server for mocking IAM API responses with realistic scenarios

**Rationale**:
- httptest.Server provides authentic HTTP client/server interaction
- Allows testing of authentication flows, error handling, and retry logic
- Can simulate network conditions and API failures
- Follows patterns from existing provider integration tests

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Interface mocking with gomock: Too abstracted from HTTP layer
- External mock services: Adds deployment complexity
- Real API testing only: Unreliable for CI/CD pipelines

### 3. Test Data Management
**Decision**: Implement test fixture builders with reasonable defaults and customization options

**Rationale**:
- Reduces test code duplication
- Provides consistent test data across test suites
- Easy to customize for specific test scenarios
- Maintainable when schema changes occur

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Static test data files: Harder to maintain and customize
- Inline test data: Creates duplication and maintenance burden
- Random data generation: Makes tests non-deterministic

### 4. Validation Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Implement comprehensive schema validation tests covering all field constraints and edge cases

**Rationale**:
- Schema validation is critical for user experience
- Edge cases often reveal security vulnerabilities
- Terraform validation errors should be clear and actionable
- Required by HashiCorp provider development best practices

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Basic validation only: Insufficient for production quality
- Runtime validation only: Doesn't catch configuration errors early
- Manual validation testing: Not scalable or reliable

### 5. Error Handling Test Coverage
**Decision**: Test all error scenarios including network failures, authentication errors, and API error responses

**Rationale**:
- Error handling is often the least tested but most critical path
- Users need meaningful error messages for troubleshooting
- Provider must gracefully handle transient failures
- Constitutional requirement for comprehensive error handling

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Happy path testing only: Insufficient for production reliability
- Limited error scenario coverage: Leaves gaps in error handling
- Error testing without user-friendly messages: Poor user experience

### 6. Performance Testing Approach
**Decision**: Include basic performance benchmarks for resource operations with memory and time measurements

**Rationale**:
- Terraform operations should complete within reasonable time limits
- Memory usage matters for large-scale resource management
- Benchmark tests catch performance regressions
- Constitutional requirement for performance validation

**Alternatives Considered**:
- No performance testing: Risk of performance regressions
- External performance testing only: Doesn't integrate with development workflow
- Complex load testing: Over-engineering for provider resource tests

## Implementation Evidence

### Existing Provider Patterns
Analysis of the existing provider implementation shows:
- OIDC authentication is properly implemented with token refresh
- Provider configuration validation follows HashiCorp conventions
- Integration tests use httptest for mocking API responses
- Test structure separates unit, integration, and acceptance concerns

### Group Resource Schema Analysis
The existing Group resource schema includes:
- Required `name` field with 255 character length validation
- Optional `description` field with 255 character length validation  
- Computed `id` field for system-generated identifiers
- Computed `status` field for resource state tracking
- Optional `tenant_id` field for multi-tenant support

### API Integration Requirements
Based on existing provider patterns, the Group resource will need:
- HTTP client configured with OIDC authentication
- Proper error mapping from HTTP status codes to Terraform errors
- Retry logic for transient failures
- Request/response logging for debugging

## Test Implementation Strategy

### Unit Test Coverage
- Schema validation for all field types and constraints
- Business logic validation for computed fields
- Error message formatting and clarity
- Input sanitization and validation

### Integration Test Coverage  
- Full CRUD operations with mock API server
- Authentication flow validation
- Error response handling
- Network failure scenarios
- Concurrent operation handling

### Acceptance Test Coverage
- End-to-end Terraform configuration lifecycle
- Resource creation, updates, and deletion
- State import and refresh operations
- Multi-resource dependency scenarios

## Quality Assurance Criteria

### Test Reliability
- Tests must be deterministic and repeatable
- No external dependencies for unit and integration tests
- Clear test isolation without shared state
- Proper cleanup in all test scenarios

### Code Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% code coverage for new implementations
- 100% coverage for critical paths (CRUD operations)
- All error paths must be tested
- Edge cases and boundary conditions covered

### Performance Benchmarks
- Resource creation: < 5 seconds
- Resource updates: < 3 seconds  
- Resource deletion: < 3 seconds
- Memory usage: < 10MB per resource operation
