# Feature Specification: Improve Resource Usability

**Feature Branch**: `009-improve-resource-usability`  
**Created**: October 2, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "improve resource usability"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Parsed: "improve resource usability" - general usability enhancement for Terraform resources
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Terraform users, DevOps engineers, infrastructure teams
   → Actions: configure resources, understand schemas, troubleshoot errors, maintain infrastructure
   → Data: resource configurations, validation feedback, documentation
   → Constraints: Terraform provider best practices, backward compatibility
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which specific usability pain points should be addressed?]
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are there particular resources that are harder to use than others?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Primary flow: User configures IAM resources with improved experience
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Requirements focused on user experience improvements
6. Identify Key Entities (resource schemas, validation messages, documentation)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding specific usability improvements"
   → Focus on user-facing improvements rather than implementation
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a DevOps engineer using the HiiRetail Terraform provider, I want to easily configure IAM resources with clear guidance and helpful feedback so that I can quickly set up secure access management without extensive trial-and-error or deep domain knowledge.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I'm configuring a new IAM group, **When** I provide invalid input, **Then** I receive clear, actionable error messages that tell me exactly what to fix
2. **Given** I'm setting up role bindings, **When** I reference roles and groups, **Then** the provider validates references and suggests corrections for typos or missing resources
3. **Given** I'm new to HiiRetail IAM, **When** I read the resource documentation, **Then** I understand all required and optional parameters with practical examples
4. **Given** I'm applying a Terraform plan, **When** resources have dependencies, **Then** the provider handles ordering automatically and provides clear progress feedback
5. **Given** I'm troubleshooting a failed apply, **When** an error occurs, **Then** I receive specific guidance on how to resolve the issue rather than generic error messages

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user provides resource names that conflict with existing resources?
- How does the system handle partial failures during multi-resource operations?
- What feedback is provided when authentication fails during resource operations?
- How are circular dependencies in role bindings detected and reported?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide descriptive validation error messages that include specific field names, expected formats, and example values
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate resource name uniqueness and provide suggestions when conflicts are detected
- **FR-003**: System MUST support resource import functionality with clear documentation on import procedures
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide comprehensive examples for each resource type covering common use cases
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate cross-resource references (e.g., role bindings referencing non-existent roles) with helpful error messages
- **FR-006**: System MUST include attribute descriptions that explain the business purpose, not just technical requirements
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide default values for optional parameters where sensible defaults exist
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate permission strings against known permission patterns with suggestions for corrections
- **FR-009**: System MUST support plan-time validation to catch configuration errors before apply operations
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide clear progress indicators during long-running operations [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific timeout thresholds and progress granularity]
- **FR-011**: System MUST include troubleshooting guides for common error scenarios [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which error scenarios are most common?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST support configuration templates or examples for typical enterprise setups [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what constitutes "typical enterprise setups"?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Resource Schema**: Defines structure, validation rules, and user-facing documentation for each resource type
- **Validation Message**: User-facing feedback that provides specific, actionable guidance for configuration errors
- **Resource Reference**: Cross-references between resources (e.g., role bindings referencing groups and roles)
- **Configuration Example**: Complete, working examples that demonstrate real-world usage patterns
- **Error Context**: Additional information provided with errors to help users understand and resolve issues
