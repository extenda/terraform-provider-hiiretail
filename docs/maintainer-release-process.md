# Maintainer Release Process Documentation

This document provides comprehensive guidance for maintainers on managing releases of the HiiRetail Terraform provider.

## ðŸš€ Release Workflow Overview

The provider uses an automated release process through GitHub Actions, triggered by semantic version tags.

### Release Types

1. **Major Release** (e.g., v1.0.0, v2.0.0)
   - Breaking changes to provider API
   - Requires migration guide
   - Full regression testing

2. **Minor Release** (e.g., v1.1.0, v1.2.0)
   - New features and resources
   - Backward compatible
   - Extended testing

3. **Patch Release** (e.g., v1.0.1, v1.0.2)
   - Bug fixes only
   - Backward compatible
   - Standard testing

4. **Pre-release** (e.g., v1.0.0-beta, v1.0.0-rc1)

```

### 6. Monitor Release Process

#### GitHub Actions Monitoring
- Navigate to: https://github.com/extenda/terraform-provider-hiiretail/actions
- Monitor the release workflow progress
- Verify all steps complete successfully

**Expected Timeline:**
- Workflow trigger: Immediate
- Build completion: 5-10 minutes
- GitHub release creation: 5-10 minutes
- Registry detection: 15-30 minutes
- Registry publication: 30-60 minutes

#### Artifact Verification
Check GitHub release includes:
- [ ] Multi-platform binary archives (.zip files)
- [ ] SHA256SUMS checksum file
- [ ] GPG signature file (.sig)
- [ ] Release notes from CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Proper semantic version tag

### 7. Post-Release Verification

#### Registry Verification
- Visit: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/extenda/hiiretail
- Verify new version appears
- Check documentation updated
- Validate installation instructions

#### Installation Testing
```bash
# Test fresh installation
mkdir test-release && cd test-release
cat > main.tf << 'EOF'
terraform {
  required_providers {
    hiiretail = {
      source  = "extenda/hiiretail"
      version = "~> 1.1.0"
    }
  }
}
EOF

terraform init
terraform providers
```

#### Smoke Testing
```bash
# Run basic provider functionality
terraform plan
terraform apply
terraform destroy
```

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting Guide

### GitHub Actions Failures

#### GPG Import Issues
**Symptoms:**
```
Error: gpg: can't connect to the agent: IPC connect call failed
```

**Solutions:**
1. Verify GPG_PRIVATE_KEY secret format:
   ```bash
   gpg --armor --export-secret-keys KEY_ID
   ```
2. Check PASSPHRASE secret is correct
3. Ensure key hasn't expired

#### Build Failures
**Symptoms:**
```
Error: failed to build for linux/amd64: exit status 1
```

**Solutions:**
1. Check Go module dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   go mod verify
   ```
2. Verify cross-compilation works locally:
   ```bash
   GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build
   ```
3. Review recent dependency changes

#### GoReleaser Configuration Errors
**Symptoms:**
```
Error: yaml: unmarshal errors
```

**Solutions:**
1. Validate configuration locally:
   ```bash
   goreleaser check
   ```
2. Test with dry run:
   ```bash
   goreleaser release --snapshot --skip-publish
   ```

### Registry Publication Issues

#### Provider Not Detected
**Cause:** Registry hasn't detected the GitHub release

**Solutions:**
1. Wait 30-60 minutes for automatic detection
2. Verify release has all required artifacts
3. Check release follows semantic versioning
4. Ensure repository is public

#### Documentation Missing
**Cause:** Documentation not generated properly

**Solutions:**
1. Verify docs/ directory structure:
   ```
   docs/
   â”œâ”€â”€ index.md
   â”œâ”€â”€ resources/
   â””â”€â”€ data-sources/
   ```
2. Check resource documentation format
3. Validate examples/ directory exists

#### Installation Failures
**Cause:** Binary compatibility or signing issues

**Solutions:**
1. Verify GPG signatures:
   ```bash
   gpg --verify *.sig
   ```
2. Test multi-platform binaries
3. Check binary naming convention

### Emergency Procedures

#### Bad Release Published
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Add warning to README.md
   - Create GitHub issue describing problems
   - Communicate to users via appropriate channels

2. **Fix and Re-release:**
   - Fix issues on main branch
   - Create patch release (e.g., v1.1.1)
   - Follow standard release process

3. **Registry Management:**
   - Contact HashiCorp if release needs removal
   - Document known issues clearly

#### Critical Security Issue
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Assess severity and impact
   - Coordinate with security team
   - Prepare security advisory

2. **Release Process:**
   - Create security patch
   - Fast-track release process
   - Notify users of security update
